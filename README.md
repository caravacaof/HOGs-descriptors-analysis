# HOGs-descriptors-analysis

The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. 

In this repository I present an analysis of this method to recognise people in any image. We will see that although there are more trendy alternatives for this purpose such as Convolutional Neural Networks, it is advisable to start by understanding these methods before the more current ones, as they can be a simple and quick solution.

I strongly recommend running the shared notebook in a Google Colabs environment.
